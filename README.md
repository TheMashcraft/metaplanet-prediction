Metaplanet metric prediction


Let's write a python script into formalized helper functions and a main function.

I was one helper function that pulls the price of Metaplanet 3350 for the last year since April 1st 2024. I also want the volume of Metaplanet 3350 to be captured.

I want a second helper function that pulls the price of Metaplanet MTPLF for as long as it has traded on OTCQX. I also want the volume of Metaplanet 3350 to be captured.

I want a third helper function that pulls the price of Metaplant DN3 for as long as it has traded on the Frankfurt stock exchange. I also want the volume of Metaplanet DN3 to be captured.

I want a 4th helper function that pulls the price of Bitcoin since 2012. I also want to capture the volume of Bitcoin traded since 2012.

I want a 5th helper function that predicts the price of Bitcoin using the Bitcoin Power Curve Cloud Cycle Law.

I want a 6th helper function that captures the number of outstanding shares of Metaplanet over time since April 1st 2024.

I want a 7th helper function that captures the number of bitcoin holdings that Metaplanet holds since April 1st 2024.

I want an 8th helper function that captures the total value of the bitcoin holdings for Metaplanet

I want a 9th helper function that calculates the mNAV of Metaplanet. The mNAV is a function of the total market cap of Metaplanet relative to the number of Bitcoin held.

I want a 10th helper function that calculates the BTC per share of Metaplanet. The BTC per share is a function of  the total bitcoin holdings divided by the total outstanding shares. Keep in mind that the number of outstanding shares keeps growing.

I want an 11th helper function that derives the future mNAV based on historical correlation to the price of BTC.

I want a 12th helper function that predicts the mNAV based on historical swings and correlation to the BTC price.

I want a 13th helper function that calculates the stock price of metaplanet 3350 based on the predicted mNAV. Keep in mind that bitcoin holdings don't change when the stock price changes

I want a 14th helper function that calculates the daily dilution of Metaplanet. Metaplanet will only dilute up to 10% of the daily volume if the price is up by at least 3%. When Metaplanet dilutes, calculate the total funds gained by the sale of 10% of the daily volume of the stock at the current day's price.

I want a 15th helper function that calculates the amount of Bitcoin that Metaplanet buys. Metaplanet buys as much Bitcoin as their stock sale provides, divided by the price of Bitcoin.


You are making a complex Bitcoin price and Bitcoin treasury stock price analysis tool. You are a highly successful python programmer and have deep knowledge of the interaction between Bitcoin price and Bitcoin Treasury metrics such as mNAV, stock price, and dilution.

I want a system that will plot the historical data that I've provided. I want these plots to be real representations and the axes of these plots aligned to those values.

After the historical data is populated, I want a forward simulation. The key of the simulation is that mNAV is sensitive to the Bitcoin price by a factor of 10:1, with large % swings in Bitcoin price producing a small % change to mNAV. When mNAV rises, volume goes higher. When mNAV falls, volume is lower. When the stock price rises, they dilute the volume of the stock at a maximum of 3% of the daily total volume.
